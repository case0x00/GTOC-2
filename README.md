second competition for the global trajectory optimization challege.

## goal

7075 asteroids were divided into 4 groups and a low-thrust propelled spacecraft had to visit one asteroid belonging to each group for a period of at least 30 days. The objective function was the ratio between the final spacecraft mass and the total mission time.

The problem was inspired also by the spacecraft Dawn designed by JPL to randezvous with two asteroids, Vesta and Ceres
